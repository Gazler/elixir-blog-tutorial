# Blog Tutorial

## Getting Phoenix

Since the blog application is built using the [Phoenix framework](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix), the first step is to generate a new Phoenix application.

1. Get phoenix by running `git clone git@github.com:phoenixframework/phoenix.git`
2. `cd phoenix`
3. Get the dependencies and compile `mix do deps.get compile`
4. Generate a new Phoenix application `mix phoenix.new blog ../blog`

This will create a Phoenix application with the default skeleton. This also needs to fetch the dependencies and compile, then we can view the default Phoenix home page in the browser.

1. `cd ../blog`
2. `mix do deps.get, compile`
3. `mix phoenix.start`
4. Navigate to http://localhost:4000

This is probably a good point to commit the application so that our code doesn't get mixed in with the code generated by Phoenix.

1. `git init`
2. `git add .`
3. `git commit`
